1. Executive Summary
Twic East County, particularly its eastern corridor bordering Duk and Murle regions, faces frequent and unpredictable armed attacks that continue to disrupt civilian safety and hinder eastward resettlement plans. This proposal introduces a Community Alert & Surveillance System designed to:
- Detect armed threats in real time
- Provide early warning alerts to civilians
- Trigger drone-based surveillance to confirm threats
- Coordinate with law enforcement and local chiefs for rapid response

This system will enhance local safety, restore confidence in resettlement, and serve as a technological bridge between vulnerable communities and law enforcement actors.
2. Objective
To track, verify, and respond to armed activity around resettlement zones in eastern Twic East County using ethical, non-invasive technology and community partnerships.
3. Background & Need
Recent years have seen:
- Escalating raids by armed Murle groups across Bor–Duk–Panyagor corridor
- Continued displacement of civilians
- Fear-based paralysis of eastward resettlement plans
- Lack of real-time threat detection or warning systems for civilians

Without early warning mechanisms or verified intelligence, communities remain exposed, and authorities are unable to act in time.
4. Proposed System Features
A. Threat Detection Tools
- SMS/WhatsApp Alert Line for real-time civilian reporting
- AI-filtered data to flag threats based on local languages and gun-related keywords
- Satellite-based fire detection (NASA FIRMS) for indirect detection of gunfire or village burnings
B. Civilian Alert Platform
- Interactive map showing red/yellow pins for reported incidents
- Auto-alert system (SMS) to notify nearby residents of danger
- Data stored securely to prevent misuse or panic
C. Drone Verification Mechanism
- Where alerts are high, drone teams (in coordination with UN or local partners) will be deployed to:
 - Confirm the presence of armed individuals
 - Capture visual evidence (stored on platform)
 - Guide police or military on intervention points
D. Law Enforcement Dashboard
- Private dashboard access for local police and military commanders
- Marked zones for patrol prioritization
- Time-stamped logs of reports and drone verifications
5. Expected Impact
Improved Civilian Safety – Communities east of Poktap, Panyagor, and Makuach can respond early to danger
Better Police Response – Verified data helps police deploy with precision
Peaceful Resettlement – Families will feel safer to return east of Twic East town
Digital Civic Engagement – Involves youth and tech-skilled individuals in safety work
6. Community Role
This system will not work without community trust and participation. Chiefs, youth, women, and elders will be invited to:
- Appoint local alert contacts (for SMS-based reports)
- Share verified information, not rumors
- Provide feedback on alerts and patrol effectiveness
7. Required Support
To begin Phase 1, the following will be needed:
- Community buy-in and support
- Authorization for SMS/WhatsApp-based communication
- Liaison officer from police or civil defense
- Permission to coordinate with drone operators or UNMISS patrol teams
- Optionally, laptops, solar kits, or devices for alert officers in remote areas
8. Budget & Timeline
A simplified budget will be created upon acceptance of this plan. Phase 1 can be implemented within 4–6 weeks.
9. Conclusion
This system is not about spying, but about protecting life, enabling peaceful return of displaced communities, and rebuilding trust between people and security institutions. With your approval and community participation, we can bring a new level of civilian protection and peacekeeping to Twic East.
